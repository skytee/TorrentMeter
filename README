= Code and data associated to a bandwith gauge =

== Methodology ==
FTTH → /sys/class/net/$dev/statistics → Perl → USB → Arduino → PWM → transistor switch → moving coil gauge :)

== ToDo ==
FTTH → /sys/class/net/$dev/statistics → SNMP → Ethernet → cheap-ass µC → PWM → transistor switch → moving coil gauge :)
